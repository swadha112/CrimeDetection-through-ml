To enhance the precision and dependability of the machine learning models in predicting the age groups of potential criminals, complete crime data from the Open Government Data (OGD) Platform India was integrated into the dataset. This comprehensive dataset includes actual crime records organized by state, type of crime, and demographic information. The primary focus for prediction is on the age and gender categories derived from the demographic data. For the analysis, the gender and age columns were combined into a single target variable, simplifying the prediction process. Additionally, Label Encoding were employed to convert categorical variables, such as state and type of crime, into numerical values. This transformation is crucial as machine learning algorithms typically perform better with numerical input. This approach significantly bolstered the ability of the models to provide accurate and actionable insights for crime forecasting. A user-friendly interface using Flask, a lightweight web framework, was built to expedite the deployment of our crime prediction model.
